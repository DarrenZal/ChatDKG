Our research continues. Lessons learned from the first field test of our design patterns, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), are being rolled into new deployment protocols and our tools continue to evolve.",

Everybody is given 5 hours worth of time coins /NFTs when they join and are free to use it. They earn time as they give and pay with time as they demand other gifts. Members are not allowed to accumulate time and there is negative interest applied for the time not used within a period. Give-receive balance is important and the economy allows a member to go at most add a more +5 hours in their balance or -5 from the balance. Zumbara encourages people to meet offline (even though there is online exchange option) as the main aim is the shift in the mindset and creation of trust based communities while sharing gifts. Upon the exchange time coin/NFT is paid to the service provider. Community starters in each region organise offline creative events, which is awarded with time. It is possible to create different communities for workplaces, NGOs, prisons, universities, cities etc and each person can join in the community they are related to or would like to explore. Each gift sharing session is provided reciprocal feedback and it is possible to create a reputation system. It is also possible to map the talent/skills/expertise in a given community/region. The system makes suggestions based on interests and services received. We actually created this system in web 2.0 combining time banking with an innovative social network in Turkey, which reached to 50k members back in 2012 becoming the world's biggest time bank in the world. We managed it as a DAO back then, not with the word DAO but creating a very decentralized system. Upon parting ways with the investor, Zumbara faded away. Web 3 provides enormous potential to re-think the model we designed back then.",

First phase is focusing on the converting people in the rental market, to our membership based living options with long term plans are to expand the offering so mortgages can also be converted into memberships - which can be owed.   Via creating the right base subsistence layer with our homes, we aim to break barriers to not just economic access, but also to bootstrapping a thriving life and selecting away from the treadmill.  We aim to change minds by accident via providing obvious ways to live, with immediate feedback loop rewards people are programmed to want now, while surprising them later with serendipitously better lives they never knew they were walking into. We give people the instagram life they want now, while baking in more that the masses (if we are honest) don't really give AF about.  We can do this, because we don't want to own the world ourselves, and are happy have secure access to the lives we give our members, and can pump all profits, all our energy, back into the community. Into the world.   We don't need to have private wealth, if we can have common wealth. We don't need to be rich, in a rich world.  We are on a mission to change how we live by making it easy and obvious for everyone else to live with and along side us. To work with us. To learn with us. To grow with us. To thrive with all of us.  Making the 99% the new 1%.",

We provide services in the areas of impact strategy, MRV for ReFi projects, bioeconomy and applied research. We are also looking for growth funding to bring our expertise in land-use issues on-chain, expanding our work in verification layers, platform projects, token incubation and oracle-based traceability of carbon-intensive commodities. Furthermore, our work addresses sustainability as a broad aspect of actions that range from building environmental sensitivity to impact mitigation, and ultimately achieving the creation of positive social and environmental impact. We operate through a specific methodology, developed at Nossa Terra Firme, that blends environmental science, social movement values, executive excellence and innovation. We are an Amazon-led, affirmative action-oriented company that has diversity as a cornerstone and as such has also contributed to creating affirmative action across the cryptocurrency industry. Our work led to the certification of the first indigenous group of ETH Developers in Brazil, in an ESG effort also coordinated with Blockchain Academy and Gama Academy. Our next steps for 2023 will include developing MRV solutions based on our on-chain methodology, expanding affirmative action in crypto, and developing impact tokens for social causes and corporate social impact.",

            "Description": "At Switch Electric, we have developed a smart metering infrastructure designed specifically to bridge the gap between distributed energy resources (such as rooftop solar assets) and the web3.0 economy. Our devices enable RWA tokenization, transforming physical DERs into digital assets and is highly adaptable / compatible with various chains and protocols. Our infrastructure seamlessly integrates with any protocol on any web3 network, thanks to the utilization of IoTeX's w3bstream IoT L2 technology.\n\nFurthermore, our smart meters facilitate the creation of on-chain renewable energy certificates (RECs). These certificates bear zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) that serve as a reliable and transparent proof of the origin and environmental impact of the energy generated from renewable sources. By leveraging the immutability and security of the blockchain, we provide an immutable record of each REC, boosting trust and ensuring the integrity of renewable energy transactions. \n\nSwitch Electric is committed to playing a crucial role in bringing this optimization to all DeEnergy protocols, enabling widespread adoption and unlocking the full potential of Web3.0 in the energy sector.",

            "Description": "For most people who do not know how to handle their used electronics properly and want it be done easily, as well as maximize the value that they can get from their e-wastes, Dulang provides a decision support tool (e.g., to fix, fix and sell, sell, donate, swap, and/or recycle) that would direct to and help consumers in the appropriate course of action and show the value to be unlocked (e.g., once fixed for x, can be sold for 10x). The output will be: 1. a recommended course of action; 2. an estimate of value that can be unlocked; 3. an option for pick-ups or drop offs, particularly for larger items (think of your 60” TV) with a nearby map; 4. e-waste circular economy contents, including ways to extend the life use of electronics and self repair in partnership with existing green content creators (e.g., ifixit); 5. gamifications and token rewards that could be facilitated through a blockchain. The tokens would represent a waste reduction credit that can be then sold in exchanges. The tokens provide a disruptive tokenization of carbon credits, particularly in relation to scope 3. Material extraction and processing account for a substantial share of carbon emission (around 50%), and therefore reducing e-wastes would: a. reduce carbon emissions (generated from the extraction, processing as well as otherwise would have resulted from illegal dumping/extraction in landfills), and b. extend the life cycle of electronics and reduce inventory cost as well as waste caused by overproducing electronics.",

When the owner of a piece purchases climate credits, the art dynamically changes, making the artwork a visual representation of climate action. Artists benefit by being able to brand themselves with climate, extend their reach through our network, and sell more art. End users benefit by owning an appreciable piece of artwork that supports climate restoration.  After our initial launch, we will create a consumer product, where our target market will be the enterprise. We will empower enterprises to offer carbon offsetting as an employee benefit and showcase this culture to the public in a verifiable way.  OUR KEY DIFFERENTIATORS - Using Art - We believe that art has the unique ability to inspire and emotionally engage people. Our product integrates the artwork from established artists. Nicole Buffett (top 50 NFT influencers), Carlos James (his art was on the August 2022 Time Magazine cover), and other top-end artists are working with us. - Blockchain Based Climate Credits - Blockchain based climate credits introduce transparency and verifiability since each credit is stamped with meta-data about the project (location, relevant images, auditor, etc.), thereby cultivating greater trust in the authenticity of the climate project - Incentivization - After the initial rollout, we will allow users to earn tokens that can be redeemed for brand rewards or traded for cash. Essentially, this creates a \"frequent flyer program\" for climate action that encourages more people to participate  - High Quality Climate Credits - Phil Taylor, a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur is on our team and helping us select high quality carbon credits that are nature based, offer clear additionality, and have secondary benefits wrt biodiversity, land health, soil health. etc.",

As an immigrant  Black Muslim community organizer of Sierra Leonean descent, I want to make sure that my work and Web3 serve my communities here in the U.S and also back home in Sierra Leone. A continued emphasis will be placed on access and onboarding of the communities I work with.  • I have begun my effort to document and preserve oral histories in Sierra Leone. The goal is to build out a scalable digital library and archive of songs and poetry. • We need to forgo colonial and centralized ways of cultural preservation. I plan to lean into decentralized file storage by utilizing IPFS x File and make these digitized works widely accessible both in Sierra Leone (Where they are collected from) and internationally. Ideally, this project will be able to present a use-case for traditional entities to adopt innovative technologies and more inclusive practices • Some of the songs will be turned into NFTS. 50% of the proceeds from The Tapestry will be allocated to continually funding cultural preservation. It will be a collaborative effort to breathe life into the storytelling traditions that are at risk of dying out by supporting the stewards financially while also onboarding more local Sierra Leoneans into Web3  • Beyond being a story and archiving of songs and poetry,  I want to build a tool other archivists, journalists, and storytellers can use to aggregate and filter metadata. The way I envision it is a front-end interface that utilizes an API like Zora Protocol to make a call for metadata from IPFS x Filecoin and allows users to interact and dynamically filter through the indexed metadata This tool will be able to bridge content on different blockchains and media that lives on Web2 with media that lives on Web3.",

Issuers use the proceeds from Investors to develop new sustainable infrastructure assets, whereas Investors receive stable cash flows from their claims against the sustainable infrastructure asset. We link the Microsite with our own WebApps, the Frigg Universe and Frigg Globe, which altogether create the Frigg Trinity.  The Frigg Universe is the homepage of Frigg, providing an overview of the different assets available and the Issuers that we work with. The Frigg Globe is a “Google Earth” style satellite imagery perspective of issuer assets and each asset’s relevant sustainability metric portfolio. It presents investors with real-time data about the assets (e.g., produced electricity, carbon avoidance). The Microsite is the issuer’s domain. It includes Detailed information about the asset backed security such as  financial reports, and legal documents (eg. Registration- and Terms of Issue) Operational performance data (eg. produced electricity and emissions avoided) that can be used by investors to calculate (real-time) asset revenue Governance framework (Investor registration/authentication, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) / Know-Your-Business (KYB) / Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) Ability to buy and sell tokens in a liquid secondary market supported by a decentralized exchange",

            "Description": "A general financial framework that would lend itself well to the VCM would be Structured Products. Broadly, structured products are defined as pre-packaged investments that normally include assets linked to interest plus one or more derivatives.  They are generally tied to an index or basket of securities and are designed to facilitate highly customized risk-return objectives. This is accomplished by taking a traditional security and replacing the usual payment features—periodic coupons and final principal—with non-traditional payoffs derived from the performance of one or more underlying assets rather than the issuer's own cash flow. In our application these assets would be Carbon Offsets, distinctly grouped by vintage and issuance year. These are highly customized risk-return objectives that can be well defined prior to capital allocation. It will work like a custom lending product with an auction layered on top.  From market research we have concluded that an effective way to scale the carbon markets is to use a 3-party pricing system which allows end buyers to lock in prices today without paying until delivery.",

We propose that a Prosperity Pool can serve as the processes, communication, and technological systems for creating, recognizing, and allocating multi-capital (financial, natural, social, spiritual, inspirational, health, wisdom, etc.) resources and coordinating human activity to enhance wellness and regenerative prosperity in omni-win consideration.  Prosperity Pooling (we like it more as a verb than a noun) begins when a community combines an evolutionary learning journey around concepts of trust, value, and purpose with the allocation and exchange of resources. We think of it as a ‘conversational space’ where we are confronted with our individual and cultural beliefs and biases that impact how we behave as economic agents. Blockchain-based accounting, token creation, governance, and data visualization supports and informs this conversation space by honoring and making more explicit the multiple forms of value being generated and exchanged in the Pool.

The brand operates in Nicaragua, and I am currently building a flagship chocolate shop/cafe in Chicago, effectively connecting consumers to source in a real and transparent way. I spent the last ~10 years living in Nicaragua building an ecosystem of businesses in hospitality, experiences, and farming and work with networks of thousands of smallholder farmers on the ground. I want to make it easier for farmers to transition over to regenerative farming practices and give them all the economic incentives possible using carbon farming and decentralized protocols that are coming online. On the consumer side, I want to make it easy for consumers to fund regeneration through a DAO and offer super customers an NFT loyalty program where a portion of funds also feeds the DAO. The main aim of the DAO will be to buy land and conserve it, with the vision of becoming an economic force that the gold miners and colonists cannot fight with.",

How we relate to each other economically will be remediated by applications (formats, templates, protocols) in the same sense that our social relations already are. Crowdfunding, P2P lending, cryptocurrencies, DAOs and DeFi, liquidity and community farming, are just the first baby steps of this transformation.\n\nEconomy is moving onto a programmable medium. We want to create a more expressive language to describe our economic networks, their participants, the nature of their relations and how they change, what they value, how it is measured and exchanged. An ECONOMIC GRAMMAR which open and free to use, gives everyone equal capacities of economic expression and does not collapse into single universal value definition of a fiat money or a “master token” (e.g. BTC, ETH etc.).\n\nSocial media horizontalized our communication, but left the information and protocol layer called the economy untouched. We can’t control the economic protocols that underpin the value capture of our communication. The next generation media will redesign the default convergence of communication, finance and computation, and fuse messaging and economy in ways that are programmable from below.\n\nThese two projects, the redesign of communications and the redesign of money are actually one. We know that you only get democracy with economic democracy, and that both imply radical decentralization.\n\nPost-capitalist economic media redesigns this convergence to express different socialities.",

The participation token allows to claim both revenue shares as well as the carbon value shares in proportion to the participation. In determining and certifying carbon value, we use web3 and data standards: time- and location-based environmental impact of solar power using available carbon-intensity data of the local power grid. The MVP only allows for direct offsetting of the carbon value on chain. The NFTs that prove the carbon offset make for a beautiful climate collection to inspire friends and family.

My co founder and I are building a B2B e procurement platform to help corporations meet their sustainability goals by offering them a variety of triple impact products and guidance, so they can switch from a traditional purchasing system to a more sustainable office supplies purchasing system, and slowly start diminishing their carbon footprint  2.  a>>Given the fact that in Argentina we need to register every commercial transaction via a CAE code and a QR which is stored in the government data base, we want to leverage this and write a smart contract to store our most significant commercial transactions with corporations, as a non fungible token. Current local system only allows you to access just your own commercial transactions, this will open the game to more eyes. b>>The NFT will have art work added, so they can also be sold to fund/collaborate with the manufacturing workshops that produce sustainable items in Argentina, mainly integrated by low income, not formally trained/educated people, people with disabilities, women and minorities that have no chances to join the work force. Or with Non Profit Org, TBD. This means we also need to build a transparent way to redirect the revenue from the NFT sell, to these manufacturing places/NPO. Which we think could be a great opportunity to collaborate with local custodial wallets and also a way to onboard more people to the crypto world.  We think there will be an incentive to buy these NFTs because, who doesn't want to help the world in such an easy way as well as brag about it by showing their triple impact NFT (triple impact because it has social impact and it is based on a sustainable purchase). 3.We want to build a Metaverse Sustainable NFT's HOUSE with different rooms for eahc of our corporate customers, hoping to use Open Metaverse spaces, so our customers and all the NFT's owners, will have the platform/space to show the NFTs they are related to, which store a sustainable transactions and the manufacturers/NPO who received the funding, to the world.",

Focusing initially on the energy transition, Reneum partners with green energy developers to vet, monitor and issue tokens they can sell on Reneum's marketplace, for a vertically-integrated approach to eco credits. Sustainability-focused companies and citizens desiring climate action buy the token to be burnt in return for a collectable NFT representing proof-of-impact (think: LEED or Fair Trade label, but for the green economy).",

It integrates elements of community psychology, social and environmental justice, positive psychology, social-emotional learning, and eco-psychology within a Solarpunk framework.  Solarpunk Generation is launching a series of projects, including an intergenerational podcast, a solarpunk summer camp, a solarpunk toolkit, and a regen-solarpunk school to generate, support, and amplify ideas and solutions that can nurture the healing of communities and the planet. The mission is to accelerate innovation, regeneration, and collective intelligence while radically addressing climate and eco-anxiety in diverse communities. All these projects and subprojects are synergistic and amplify and support the development of the others. These projects will lead to local and global networks of eco-hubs and common pools of resources to connect on-the-ground regenerative projects with children, youth, families, and diverse communities, including neurodiverse communities. These communities need access and exposure to refi, web3, and regenerative education to engage with these initiatives and identify their unique roles in building a regenerative, solarpunk future. Solarpunk Generation is also working on live events, workshops, and education on refi and regeneration to invite more diverse communities into the movement and connect them with mentors and resources to support existing initiatives or create their own.",
