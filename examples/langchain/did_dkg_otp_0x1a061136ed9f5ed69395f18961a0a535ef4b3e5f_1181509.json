But these tools are not without consequence. The impact on people, communities and natural ecosystems already facing climate inaction must be considered when developing both the technology solutions and their implementation.\n\nThis paper is an output of the Crypto Sustainability Coalitions Working Group on Web3 Climate Action, exploring the relationship between blockchain innovation and climate action, focusing on real work examples and use cases. It is intended as a primer for those unfamiliar with regenerative finance (ReFi) and a guide to those incorporating blockchain technologies into decarbonization or net-zero commitments. Investigating how blockchain can incentivize a planet-positive economy focused on financing regeneration and climate action at scale, the paper calls for thoughtful coordination, meaningful action, education and regulation to accelerate the adoption and implementation of blockchain across decarbonization sectors."

How can we create space for active #dialogue, #diversity of thought, and #cocreation?\n\n Since Jan 2021, ReFi DAO has built an ecosystem attracting hundreds of #founders & #investors, an online #community of thousands, and dozens of events across the globe    In Feb 2022, a vision was announced for a network state to regenerate the earth. A new nation. One that is geographically dispersed across the globe, but bound together in alignment with the principles of regeneration.\n\n But the future of ReFi DAO is not ours alone, it belongs to YOU. We need the diverse voices of our stakeholders to guide the journey, and we need to bring clarity on the #ownership and #governance structure... As such, we're setting off on a journey towards an #ExitToCommunity within the next 12-24 months. This won't be a quick fix. It's a long-term commitment - and we invite you to co-create this vision with us! We're stronger together. \n\n The ReFi DAO Forum is our instrument for this co-creation. The mission? To foster open & collaborative discussions, and to help shape our future of ReFi DAO through active community participation. Come join! We will draw on inspiration from #LiberatingStructures, #Holacracy & #Sociocracy, Androgynous Organization, #Diversity & #Inclusion, the #MediciEffect, and Consent-based #Governance. The aim? To create a #Democratic, #Inclusive, and #Creative environment for co-creation.\n\nSo join us for the next session 'To Network State or not to Network State?' Come share perspectives on all things #NetworkState, ReFi DAO Nation, and explore alternative models... #StartupSociety? #NetworkSociety? #CoordiNATION? \n\nRegister here  https://lnkd.in/eaWjw9iA"

While its value and impacts have been hotly contested, its vast energy consumption has left a shameful carbon footprint in its wake. At the same time, scientists warn we need rapid systemic changes to save ourselves from environmental, ecological and economic collapse. What if we could harness the powers of crypto to create exponential progress in saving the planet? What if we could create systems that are not simply sustainable, but regenerative by design?  Monty is a change-maker exploring and experimenting with new systems and technologies to build a better future. He was the lead author of the Smart & Sustainable Energy Guide for non-executive directors recently published by Chapter Zero, and is currently undertaking his masters. In 2019 he won the Bristol New Enterprise Ideas Competition in his project to reimagine impact investing. Taking this further, he has just launched his company PeoplePower - harnessing regenerative crypto finance to fund environmental projects and create exponential impact.

Besides yourself, how many other stakeholders have committed themselves to this project?\n\n04:55 - The Token Engineering Commons (TEC) was the first to use our Commons design patterns (technical build and cultural build). Is there anything, in particular, about the TEC or its deployment that stands out for you? Is there anything that you think was done very well or could have been done better?\n\n06:08 - Does your community have stakeholders that are not already familiar with web3? If so, have you thought about the plan to onboard them?\n\n07:48 - Our cultural build is largely based on Elinor Ostroms 8 principles for governing commons. Are you, or your community, already familiar with these principles? Would you say that one or more are already part of the communitys existing practices?\n\n08:29 - The first Commons deployment was done on Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai Chain). Would there be any reason for your Commons not to deploy on this chain?\n\nJoin us: https://discord.gg/eh2S9FqwDR\nFollow us: http://twitter.com/CommonsStack\nRead more: http://commonsstack.org"

          "@value": "Todays guest is Helena Merk current founder of Spirals Protocol. Their mission is to be bringing externalities into the economic model by building regenerative infra for the new economy.\n\nSpirals mission in other words is to help people have an access to vote on public goods. What to do with public goods and how to leverage them for the collective.\n\nHelena recently had a successful exit with her last company called: Glimpse, literally Building belonging! Started with college campuses that went virtual during the covid 19 pandemic, and shifted to remote teams. Acquired by a direct competitor that shared their mission and vision to build a more authentically connected world.\n\nHer most recent update is a collaboration between Eco Labs and Spirals Protocol. The Eco Labs mission is to unlock the ability to issue ecological assets at small scales, creating a new career path: Regeneration as an occupation. Theyre doing this by focusing on practice-based methodologies for environmental stewardship. Leveraging emerging innovations in dMRV (decentralized + digital measuring, reporting, and verification) to record Proof-of-Impact in a low cost and accessible way.\n\nTogether, Eco Labs and Spirals build a positive climate impact flywheel Collaboration roadmap:\n\nEco Labs stakes with Spirals through $cUSD staking\nEco Labs practice-based environmental credits are added for review to the climate council\nIf approved, Eco Labs will immediately be eligible for funding!\nWhy Eco Labs?\n\nTo scale any climate solution, we need to scale remote monitoring and verification. The Impact App by the Eco Labs team does exactly this by:\non-boarding Regenerators into dMRV ecosystems, and\nproviding simple dMRV data capture via images & location verification via their mobile app.\n\nThe team behind Eco Labs is stellar: watching their progress in just the last few weeks in ReFi DAO founder circles, has been exciting."

GitcoinDAO governs Gitcoin Grants, a significant pillar of the Ethereum community.\n\nIn this episode, the panelists share their experiences at each stage of GitcoinDAO, the past, present, and future. The objective was to take you on a journey of how a 300-person DAO does governance. However, governance is evolutionary. This is only a snapshot in time.\n\nTake the green pill anon."

Its mission is to make carbon markets accessible and transparent, enabling the efficient and early flow of capital to be invested directly into projects that combat climate change. FlowCarbon is committed to driving real impact for people, biodiversity, and the planet. Phil has deep expertise in finance and market research. Phil is also currently the managing partner at Corner3 Ventures, a seed and early-stage angel investing firm. Previously he was head of strategy at Bitgreen, COO of Datavore, he has started a financial services company, and a blockchain startup. We discuss FlowCarbon, Carbon Credits, ReFi, Climate Change, and much more. We begin our conversation by discussing carbon credits. Phil explains at a high level the role of carbon credits and how it benefits the environment. We discuss how by providing an economic incentive to decarbonize, we will help push society toward renewable energy. We discuss the changing narrative around climate change and the push for ESG. Phil explains why the current carbon credit marketplace is so complex. We discuss how FlowCarbon is bringing the carbon credit market on-chain. Phil explains the benefits of putting carbon credits on a blockchain. We discuss an emerging crypto sector called ReFi, or Regenerative Finance. Phil explains the movement behind ReFi. We discuss the importance of providing an economic incentive to solve climate change. We pivot our conversation to discuss how Phil fell down the crypto rabbit hole and how he concluded that blockchain technology can be used to construct new economic paradigms. We transitioned our conversation to discuss why FlowCarbon decided to build on top of Celo. Phil explains how decentralizing the carbon credit market opens the market up to a new set of participants who wouldve never had access to it in the traditional system. We discuss the second-order effects of making the carbon credit market more efficient and transparent. We discuss how blockchains are investing a portion of their block rewards to help fight climate change. We also discuss the positive impact of having non-financial use cases for blockchain as a positive for regulators. Our final discussion topic centered around FlowCarbons future roadmap. Please enjoy my conversation with Phil Fogel."
