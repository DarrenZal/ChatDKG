Most of my time has been spent working with rural communities on various projects. In 2018, my wife and I co-founded Nature\'s Nectar, a sustainable honey company that works with rural communities near conservation areas to put a direct value on forests via sustainable beekeeping. In 2020, just as covid was hitting, I started mentally spiraling downwards for various reasons. I tried to get help with little avail and things just kept getting worse. The only thing that started me spiraling upwards and out of my depression was blockchain. Once I started to learn about these technologies from a base level, I saw many of the problems that caused my mental health to fall, disappear. I had found a system that is more transparent, fair, equitable and accessible than the ones I was working in before. I want to help more people see this. I want to help spread what blockchain has to offer and show people that its not all ponzi schemes and digital apes. There is true and new value in these systems if they are applied well and ecological/environmental markets are one of the best use cases out there for blockchain.", headline: "Core-Contributor to MRV101\nCo-Founder of Nature\'s Nectar - I\'m aiming to bring hives, honey, beekeepers and ecological value produced from beekeeping on chain for all Zambian beekeepers. oREGENals, but that feels like it\'s losing steam because of other commitments for the Initiators.", image: https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1695693600000/foBOmQrDEYRa3Mm-9jU5GQ/GmhKnHLd8qFs3VJTFT5nuWH_GwRyr6i7Ok55LTju0EG0fQ_5PolQ-L_m7yiMQ2FX0X9O9uoXH61hy-pOvyDKfgw5oSD52HtmVhUkVreFvBn5Oh4lm9eTnpYfQpZsJq2r/tbhWlp1Xshw6U0g9w9HimLtUliUhLPq01xy4J6RIr80<br>entity: https://example.com/urn:profile:LuizEduardoAbreuHadad, name: "Luiz Eduardo Abreu Hadad", image: https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1695693600000/GEL9E9qLB9-Lhp1zIl6XKw/0pfgdCTqPNAecPEWQ6PMnmpfERG_jpJEYiF5bRH7etLc2Eh5Qf-GX6bmqzHIxLsl7ojTRWJbCAQ03pLflGrJ4SM_P7_Rt7_PTp_xIJEFx8s/DPXgiRrSA9wkiWL4e8SZnPo7lYtKj4st_QMZUSeAplQ<br>entity: https://example.com/urn:profile:MagentaCeiba, name: "Magenta Ceiba", image: https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1695693600000/jmim5OrQrCxUbWWEJDpH9g/Ya7XSKaOmleHGTz5Xuv7-e9cCVuMetIuMixB0MFhX2JkeG3JE5WhBUIkb44RNi81M0C3YJAiMBYAKCyB0lzlAQjxuS2byTtsS2ycVJju9bk/DCjsND1J-mtsRYkG9AYGAukfIrogQyBSFTBLE7fDJ0M<br>entity: https://example.com/urn:profile:ManuAlzuru, name: "Manu Alzuru", image: https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1695693600000/N6Sl5Y7k1EQJc8SRlmYoMQ/oJOp50-p1sTOqsPcMnpa80lQB6_3GfETv8fWLAWRwDZ1OoP9JDHibAJSj5POq5IX0hZKN9h6G1xNOp3Jd9C0J0IpFhDHGSWCXFUj88wlf-Q/hSSo8Pu7emiekNuDBe8mhEXeqrnsG0PANsM2x0-RBLc<br>entity: https://example.com/urn:profile:MarcusAM, name: "Marcus AM", image: https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v1/21/21/1695693600000/vh6k3m0i5vq1hNbBkal5ew/Gwv2VRYU3dLiYnJkvjU8mW7prMCbejlhEiu3WECZRzdW2PjupC7XgfJ6o7ky7JMwfuzCB7vBHt3YdUIeK0COxReAB2Dmgosn-ROglvNHJqI/3L5KPQ992nNpSohkdPaU-OmeQd8b7TN5De3RZmmLFQo<br>entity: https://example.com/urn:profile:MartnLacruzSandoval, name: "Martín Lacruz Sandoval", description: "Punto Verde es un emprendimiento local de gestion y tratamiento de residuos.

By leveraging blockchain technology and innovative financial mechanisms, ReFi aims to support sustainable development and environmental regeneration. Here are some ways ReFi contributes to addressing the climate crisis:<br><br>- <strong>Carbon Removal Projects:</strong> Organizations like Reverse Climate Change utilize unique tokenomics to finance carbon removal projects. A portion of transactions involving their ERC-20 token (RVRS) is dedicated to funding these initiatives, directly contributing to reducing atmospheric CO2 levels.<br><br>- <strong>Access to Voluntary Carbon Markets:</strong> Platforms such as Climate Impact X are being developed to provide traditional finance (TradFi) investors with access to voluntary carbon markets. This facilitates the funding of projects that aim to offset carbon emissions, thereby supporting efforts to mitigate climate change.<br><br>- <strong>Automated Carbon Offsetting:</strong> Solutions like Climatefutures.io's 1PLANET enable automated carbon offsetting between smart contracts. Their marketplace offers access to eco-assets worldwide, promoting investments in sustainability.<br><br>- <strong>Supporting Renewable Energy and Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> ReFi organizations are also working in areas such as renewable energy and sustainable food or agriculture, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promoting practices that are in harmony with the Earth's ecosystems.<br><br>Overall, ReFi represents a promising approach to mobilizing financial resources and technological innovations in the fight against the climate crisis, by supporting projects and initiatives that aim to regenerate the environment and promote sustainability."}}
