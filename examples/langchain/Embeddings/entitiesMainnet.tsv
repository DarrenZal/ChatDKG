https://refidao.com/urn:profile:KyleCurry	Kyle Curry; I am a social and environmental entrepreneur who has lived in Zambia since 2014. Most of my time has been spent working with rural communities on various projects. In 2018, my wife and I co-founded Nature's Nectar, a sustainable honey company that works with rural communities near conservation areas to put a direct value on forests via sustainable beekeeping. In 2020, just as covid was hitting, I started mentally spiraling downwards for various reasons. I tried to get help with little avail and things just kept getting worse. The only thing that started me spiraling upwards and out of my depression was blockchain. Once I started to learn about these technologies from a base level, I saw many of the problems that caused my mental health to fall, disappear. I had found a system that is more transparent, fair, equitable and accessible than the ones I was working in before. I want to help more people see this. I want to help spread what blockchain has to offer and show people that its not all ponzi schemes and digital apes. There is true and new value in these systems if they are applied well and ecological/environmental markets are one of the best use cases out there for blockchain.	type: Person; Kyle Curry; I am a social and environmental entrepreneur who has lived in Zambia since 2014.

We work with established artists by connecting their art to climate restoration efforts via the blockchain. When the owner of a piece purchases climate credits, the art dynamically changes, making the artwork a visual representation of climate action. Artists benefit by being able to brand themselves with climate, extend their reach through our network, and sell more art. End users benefit by owning an appreciable piece of artwork that supports climate restoration. After our initial launch, we will create a consumer product, where our target market will be the enterprise. We will empower enterprises to offer carbon offsetting as an employee benefit and showcase this culture to the public in a verifiable way.  OUR KEY DIFFERENTIATORS -Using Art- We believe that art has the unique ability to inspire and emotionally engage people. Our product integrates the artwork from established artists. Nicole Buffett top 50 NFT influencers, Carlos James his art was on the August 2022 Time Magazine cover, and other top-end artists are working with us. -Blockchain Based Climate Credits- Blockchain based climate credits introduce transparency and verifiability since each credit is stamped with meta-data about the project location, relevant images, auditor, etc., thereby cultivating greater trust in the authenticity of the climate project -Incentivization- After the initial rollout, we will allow usersto earn tokens that can be redeemed for brand rewards or traded for cash. Essentially, this creates a frequent flyer program for climate action that encourages more people to participate -High Quality Climate Credits- Phil Taylor; founder: Building Fully Auditable  EfficientSustainability Markets on Hedera - Geisenberger,DMRV Roundtable - Wes Geisenberger; funder: a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur is on our team and helping us select high quality carbon credits that are nature based	did:dkg:otp/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4162411

https://refidao.com/urn:organization:Dulang	Dulang; For most people who do not know how to handle their used electronics properly and want it be done easily, as well as maximize the value that they can get from their e-wastes, Dulang provides a decision support tool (e.g., to fix, fix and sell, sell, donate, swap, and/or recycle) that would direct to and help consumers in the appropriate course of action and show the value to be unlocked (e.g., once fixed for x, can be sold for 10x).

https://refidao.com/urn:organization:OmniHarmonicVenturesMulticapitalProsperityPools	OmniHarmonic Ventures Multicapital Prosperity Pools; Helping humans across cultures learn to see and be seen for the diverse gifts and forms of value we each offer and receive.  We propose that a Prosperity Pool can serve as the processes, communication, and technological systems for creating, recognizing, and allocating multi-capital (financial, natural, social, spiritual, inspirational, health, wisdom, etc.) resources and coordinating human activity to enhance wellness and regenerative prosperity in omni-win consideration.  Prosperity Pooling (we like it more as a verb than a noun) begins when a community combines an evolutionary learning journey around concepts of trust, value, and purpose with the allocation and exchange of resources. We think of it as a conversational space where we are confronted with our individual and cultural beliefs and biases that impact how we behave as economic agents. Blockchain-based accounting, token creation, governance, and data visualization supports and informs this conversation space by honoring and making more explicit the multiple forms of value being generated and exchanged in the Pool.

This is accomplished by taking a traditional security and replacing the usual payment featuresperiodic coupons and final principalwith non-traditional payoffs derived from the performance of one or more underlying assets rather than the issuer's own cash flow.

This is accomplished by taking a traditional security and replacing the usual payment featuresperiodic coupons and final principalwith non-traditional payoffs derived from the performance of one or more underlying assets rather than the issuer's own cash flow. In our application these assets would be Carbon Offsets, distinctly grouped by vintage and issuance year. These are highly customized risk-return objectives that can be well defined prior to capital allocation. It will work like a custom lending product with an auction layered on top.  From market research we have concluded that an effective way to scale the carbon markets is to use a 3-party pricing system which allows end buyers to lock in prices today without paying until delivery.; employee: Rishabh Varshney; founder: Rishabh Varshney	did:dkg:otp/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4162411

Our goal is to regenerate the environment and digital ecosystems with redeemable NFTs tied to physical items that are timeless, disruptive, functional (yoga mat carriers, pet toys, home apparel...) and durable. ; employee: Hmeyra Cengiz; founder: Hmeyra Cengiz	did:dkg:otp/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4162411

https://refidao.com/urn:organization:Zumbara	Zumbara; Zumbara creates a map-based gift marketplace app where people offer their gifts/ask for others' gifts in exchange for time coins. Everybody is given 5 hours worth of time coins /NFTs when they join and are free to use it. They earn time as they give and pay with time as they demand other gifts. Members are not allowed to accumulate time and there is negative interest applied for the time not used within a period. Give-receive balance is important and the economy allows a member to go at most add a more +5 hours in their balance or -5 from the balance. Zumbara encourages people to meet offline (even though there is online exchange option) as the main aim is the shift in the mindset and creation of trust based communities while sharing gifts. Upon the exchange time coin/NFT is paid to the service provider. Community starters in each region organise offline creative events, which is awarded with time. It is possible to create different communities for workplaces, NGOs, prisons, universities, cities etc and each person can join in the community they are related to or would like to explore. Each gift sharing session is provided reciprocal feedback and it is possible to create a reputation system. It is also possible to map the talent/skills/expertise in a given community/region. The system makes suggestions based on interests and services received. We actually created this system in web 2.0 combining time banking with an innovative social network in Turkey, which reached to 50k members back in 2012 becoming the world's biggest time bank in the world. We managed it as a DAO back then, not with the word DAO but creating a very decentralized system. Upon parting ways with the investor, Zumbara faded away. Web 3 provides enormous potential to re-think the model we designed back then.	type: Organization; Zumbara; Zumbara creates a map-based gift marketplace app where people offer their gifts/ask for others' gifts in exchange for time coins.
