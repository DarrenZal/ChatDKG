As an immigrant  Black Muslim community organizer of Sierra Leonean descent, I want to make sure that my work and Web3 serve my communities here in the U.S and also back home in Sierra Leone. A continued emphasis will be placed on access and onboarding of the communities I work with.   I have begun my effort to document and preserve oral histories in Sierra Leone. The goal is to build out a scalable digital library and archive of songs and poetry.  We need to forgo colonial and centralized ways of cultural preservation. I plan to lean into decentralized file storage by utilizing IPFS x File and make these digitized works widely accessible both in Sierra Leone Where they are collected from and internationally. Ideally, this project will be able to present a use-case for traditional entities to adopt innovative technologies and more inclusive practices  Some of the songs will be turned into NFTS. 50 of the proceeds from The Tapestry will be allocated to continually funding cultural preservation. It will be a collaborative effort to breathe life into the storytelling traditions that are at risk of dying out by supporting the stewards financially while also onboarding more local Sierra Leoneans into Web3   Beyond being a story and archiving of songs and poetry,  I want to build a tool other archivists, journalists, and storytellers can use to aggregate and filter metadata. The way I envision it is a front-end interface that utilizes an API like Zora Protocol to make a call for metadata from IPFS x Filecoin and allows users to interact and dynamically filter through the indexed metadata This tool will be able to bridge content on different blockchains and media that lives on Web2 with media that lives on Web3.; funder: Ibraheem Bangura	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2203432

Everybody is given 5 hours worth of time coins /NFTs when they join and are free to use it. They earn time as they give and pay with time as they demand other gifts. Members are not allowed to accumulate time and there is negative interest applied for the time not used within a period. Give-receive balance is important and the economy allows a member to go at most add a more +5 hours in their balance or -5 from the balance. Zumbara encourages people to meet offline (even though there is online exchange option) as the main aim is the shift in the mindset and creation of trust based communities while sharing gifts. Upon the exchange time coin/NFT is paid to the service provider. Community starters in each region organise offline creative events, which is awarded with time. It is possible to create different communities for workplaces, NGOs, prisons, universities, cities etc and each person can join in the community they are related to or would like to explore. Each gift sharing session is provided reciprocal feedback and it is possible to create a reputation system. It is also possible to map the talent/skills/expertise in a given community/region. The system makes suggestions based on interests and services received. We actually created this system in web 2.0 combining time banking with an innovative social network in Turkey, which reached to 50k members back in 2012 becoming the world's biggest time bank in the world. We managed it as a DAO back then, not with the word DAO but creating a very decentralized system. Upon parting ways with the investor, Zumbara faded away.

Flowcarbon is a pioneering climate technology company that brings carbon credits onto the blockchain. Its mission is to make carbon markets accessible and transparent, enabling the efficient and early flow of capital to be invested directly into projects that combat climate change. FlowCarbon is committed to driving real impact for people, biodiversity, and the planet. Phil has deep expertise in finance and market research. Phil is also currently the managing partner at Corner3 Ventures, a seed and early-stage angel investing firm. Previously he was head of strategy at Bitgreen, COO of Datavore, he has started a financial services company, and a blockchain startup. We discuss FlowCarbon, Carbon Credits, ReFi, Climate Change, and much more. We begin our conversation by discussing carbon credits. Phil explains at a high level the role of carbon credits and how it benefits the environment. We discuss how by providing an economic incentive to decarbonize, we will help push society toward renewable energy. We discuss the changing narrative around climate change and the push for ESG. Phil explains why the current carbon credit marketplace is so complex. We discuss how FlowCarbon is bringing the carbon credit market on-chain. Phil explains the benefits of putting carbon credits on a blockchain. We discuss an emerging crypto sector called ReFi, or Regenerative Finance. Phil explains the movement behind ReFi. We discuss the importance of providing an economic incentive to solve climate change. We pivot our conversation to discuss how Phil fell down the crypto rabbit hole and how he concluded that blockchain technology can be used to construct new economic paradigms. We transitioned our conversation to discuss why FlowCarbon decided to build on top of Celo. Phil explains how decentralizing the carbon credit market opens the market up to a new set of participants who wouldve never had access to it in the traditional system. We discuss the second-order effects of making the carbon credit market more efficient and transparent. We discuss how blockchains are investing a portion of their block rewards to help fight climate change. We also discuss the positive impact of having non-financial use cases for blockchain as a positive for regulators. Our final discussion topic centered around FlowCarbons future roadmap. Please enjoy my conversation with Phil Fogel.	type: CreativeWork; name: Regenerative Finance with Phil Fogel - YouTube; description: Todays guest is Phil Fogel, the co-founder and Chief Blockchain Officer at FlowCarbon.

Round 2 is The Optimism Collectives second round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)\n\n\nRetroPGF 2 will allocate 10m OP tokens to fund public goods that support development and usage of the OP Stack. Optimisms vision is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual. RetroPGF is an experimental mechanism to realize this goal of impact = profit.
