After graduating, he separated himself from the world of economics and finance to pursue his goals of making the world a more equitable and sustainable place for all. He was dissatisfied with the entrenched financial system because of the old boys club mentality, and drastic disproportionate distribution of wealth and access to capital. These barriers to entry and greed centered motives are why Cash did not immediately get into the world of finance after graduating from Berkeley.\n\nCash recognized the value in cryptocurrency as a secure and deflationary money, but didnt fall in love with Bitcoin. His love affair with blockchain principles didnt start until he discovered the additional Web3 services that the Ethereum network could provide, and the ability the blockchain has to bring access to financial services to the 40% of adults in the world who currently have access to no bank.\n\nCash is also an avid NFT supporter (and owner) who believes that blockchain technology will make the notion of starving artists a thing of the past.

https://example.com/urn:profile:KyleCurry	Kyle Curry	type: Person; Kyle Curry; description: I am a social and environmental entrepreneur who has lived in Zambia since 2014. Most of my time has been spent working with rural communities on various projects. In 2018, my wife and I co-founded Nature's Nectar, a sustainable honey company that works with rural communities near conservation areas to put a direct value on forests via sustainable beekeeping. In 2020, just as covid was hitting, I started mentally spiraling downwards for various reasons. I tried to get help with little avail and things just kept getting worse. The only thing that started me spiraling upwards and out of my depression was blockchain. Once I started to learn about these technologies from a base level, I saw many of the problems that caused my mental health to fall, disappear. I had found a system that is more transparent, fair, equitable and accessible than the ones I was working in before. I want to help more people see this. I want to help spread what blockchain has to offer and show people that its not all ponzi schemes and digital apes. There is true and new value in these systems if they are applied well and ecological/environmental markets are one of the best use cases out there for blockchain.; publicprofilechecked: checked	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/1181441

https://example.com/urn:profile:leehyein	lee hye in	type: Person; lee hye in; description: ReFi Seoul introduces the refi movement to Seoul.\nReFi Seoul is a community dedicated to promoting financial inclusion and wealth redistribution through the use of blockchain technology. We believe that the decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain has the potential to empower individuals and communities by providing access to fair and efficient financial services. Our mission is to educate and raise awareness about the benefits of blockchain and the Refi movement in Seoul, South Korea. We publish research articles, provide educational resources, and hold regular meetups to bring together like-minded individuals and organizations.\n\nIn Korea, there are many projects related to the environment, mainly cute NFT projects. In fact, very few people in Korea know the concept of refi, so we wrote an article to promote refi. And we hosted a session with a former Open Forest Protocol employee.Based on the published article, we are going to onboard Korean web2 people by April. It is because there are few people in the blockchain industry who are engaged in the impact field. And until now, I was only active in Korea, but I'm trying to communicate a lot with overseas.\n\n\n\nONBLOCK is a community for korea web3 builders to grow their careers.\nWe hold regular lectures and discussions once a month for certified Web3 builders in the field.\nAs speakers, there were co-founder of radius with ZK solution, aws and unity pm, ground x pm, mina protocol ambassador, hashed pd, solana dev, etc. The characteristic of our event is that we sit at a table in groups of 5-6 and discuss and interview the topic, rather than simply listening to a lecture.\n\nand I received support for 3 months from Hanwha + Hashed's Accelerating / Hackathon and won the winner.\n\nand I pitched the M2E game project at the Solana Seoul Demo Day. Participated as a developer and team lead.; publicprofilechecked: checked	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/1181441

We propose that a Prosperity Pool can serve as the processes, communication, and technological systems for creating, recognizing, and allocating multi-capital (financial, natural, social, spiritual, inspirational, health, wisdom, etc.) resources and coordinating human activity to enhance wellness and regenerative prosperity in omni-win consideration.  Prosperity Pooling (we like it more as a verb than a noun) begins when a community combines an evolutionary learning journey around concepts of trust, value, and purpose with the allocation and exchange of resources. We think of it as a conversational space where we are confronted with our individual and cultural beliefs and biases that impact how we behave as economic agents. Blockchain-based accounting, token creation, governance, and data visualization supports and informs this conversation space by honoring and making more explicit the multiple forms of value being generated and exchanged in the Pool.

https://example.com/urn:organization:Sequestr	Sequestr	type: Organization; Sequestr; description: A general financial framework that would lend itself well to the VCM would be Structured Products. Broadly, structured products are defined as pre-packaged investments that normally include assets linked to interest plus one or more derivatives.  They are generally tied to an index or basket of securities and are designed to facilitate highly customized risk-return objectives. This is accomplished by taking a traditional security and replacing the usual payment featuresperiodic coupons and final principalwith non-traditional payoffs derived from the performance of one or more underlying assets rather than the issuer's own cash flow. In our application these assets would be Carbon Offsets, distinctly grouped by vintage and issuance year. These are highly customized risk-return objectives that can be well defined prior to capital allocation. It will work like a custom lending product with an auction layered on top.  From market research we have concluded that an effective way to scale the carbon markets is to use a 3-party pricing system which allows end buyers to lock in prices today without paying until delivery.; employee: Rishabh Varshney; founder: Rishabh Varshney	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2203432

Solarpunk Generation is launching a series of projects, including an intergenerational podcast, a solarpunk summer camp, a solarpunk toolkit, and a regen-solarpunk school to generate, support, and amplify ideas and solutions that can nurture the healing of communities and the planet. The mission is to accelerate innovation, regeneration, and collective intelligence while radically addressing climate and eco-anxiety in diverse communities. All these projects and subprojects are synergistic and amplify and support the development of the others. These projects will lead to local and global networks of eco-hubs and common pools of resources to connect on-the-ground regenerative projects with children, youth, families, and diverse communities, including neurodiverse communities. These communities need access and exposure to refi, web3, and regenerative education to engage with these initiatives and identify their unique roles in building a regenerative, solarpunk future. Solarpunk Generation is also working on live events, workshops, and education on refi and regeneration to invite more diverse communities into the movement and connect them with mentors and resources to support existing initiatives or create their own. ; employee: Dayana Sanchez; founder: Dayana Sanchez	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2203432

As an immigrant  Black Muslim community organizer of Sierra Leonean descent, I want to make sure that my work and Web3 serve my communities here in the U.S and also back home in Sierra Leone. A continued emphasis will be placed on access and onboarding of the communities I work with.   I have begun my effort to document and preserve oral histories in Sierra Leone. The goal is to build out a scalable digital library and archive of songs and poetry.  We need to forgo colonial and centralized ways of cultural preservation. I plan to lean into decentralized file storage by utilizing IPFS x File and make these digitized works widely accessible both in Sierra Leone Where they are collected from and internationally. Ideally, this project will be able to present a use-case for traditional entities to adopt innovative technologies and more inclusive practices  Some of the songs will be turned into NFTS. 50 of the proceeds from The Tapestry will be allocated to continually funding cultural preservation. It will be a collaborative effort to breathe life into the storytelling traditions that are at risk of dying out by supporting the stewards financially while also onboarding more local Sierra Leoneans into Web3   Beyond being a story and archiving of songs and poetry,  I want to build a tool other archivists, journalists, and storytellers can use to aggregate and filter metadata. The way I envision it is a front-end interface that utilizes an API like Zora Protocol to make a call for metadata from IPFS x Filecoin and allows users to interact and dynamically filter through the indexed metadata This tool will be able to bridge content on different blockchains and media that lives on Web2 with media that lives on Web3.; funder: Ibraheem Bangura	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2203432

Everybody is given 5 hours worth of time coins /NFTs when they join and are free to use it. They earn time as they give and pay with time as they demand other gifts. Members are not allowed to accumulate time and there is negative interest applied for the time not used within a period. Give-receive balance is important and the economy allows a member to go at most add a more +5 hours in their balance or -5 from the balance. Zumbara encourages people to meet offline (even though there is online exchange option) as the main aim is the shift in the mindset and creation of trust based communities while sharing gifts. Upon the exchange time coin/NFT is paid to the service provider. Community starters in each region organise offline creative events, which is awarded with time. It is possible to create different communities for workplaces, NGOs, prisons, universities, cities etc and each person can join in the community they are related to or would like to explore. Each gift sharing session is provided reciprocal feedback and it is possible to create a reputation system. It is also possible to map the talent/skills/expertise in a given community/region. The system makes suggestions based on interests and services received. We actually created this system in web 2.0 combining time banking with an innovative social network in Turkey, which reached to 50k members back in 2012 becoming the world's biggest time bank in the world.

Wait - isn’t this just DeFi by another name ? Why do we need this new term ?\n\nBecause in reality, the DeFi tools and applications that exist today fall far too short of the true potential to democratize finance. At best DeFi has created a safe haven for the privileged to protect themselves against the existing paradigm, while the rest of the world is stuck in a cyclical downward spiral of rising debt and declining opportunities to improve their economic status.\n\nWe are forming this CoFi working group to unite around what we are building for, not only what we are building against. Our founding members are collectively building the tools that empower communities to form their own collaborative economies in which little to no preexisting capital is needed, and where value can originate and recirculate in local networks. We aim to develop practical tools that don’t reinforce the existing capital allocation biases in our current economic frameworks. Instead our systems alchemize capital into new forms of value that optimize for more than just financial returns, namely our creative potential, societal betterment, and the opportunity to pursue a fulfilling, meaningful life.; stewards: Monty Merlin Bryant	did:dkg:otp/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/1967103
